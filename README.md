# Project Overview

This course project for WIA1007: Introduction to Data Science at University of Malaya focuses on developing essential data science skills, including:

**Data Processing:** Handling missing values, data cleaning, and standardization.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): ** Understanding and visualizing data relationships. Handle of imbalance data and avoid impact of overfitting or underfitting of data by figuring the correlation between features and target
**Basic Machine Learning:** Implementing predictive models with foundational techniques.

The project serves as a practical application of data science concepts learned in the course and highlights the end-to-end process of solving real-world problems using data.

# Workflow and Steps

**1. Data Loading and Understanding**
Imported the dataset from Kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud
Summarized dataset features and target variables.
In this project, our target is 'fraud' to determine a credit card user's potential to be trap in a credit card fraud due to various factors.

**2. Data Preprocessing**
Cleaned data by handling missing and duplicate values.
Standardized column names and corrected data types.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Visualized distributions, trends, and correlations using plots.
Analyzed relationships and identified key patterns in the data.

**4. Data Normalization and Feature Scaling**
Applied normalization techniques to ensure uniformity in data range.
Scaled features for optimal performance in machine learning models.

**5. Imbalanced Data Handling**
Addressed class imbalances using:
Oversampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE).
Undersampling or weighted class adjustments.

**7. Machine Learning**
Implemented basic machine learning models:
XG Boost
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gaussian Naive Bayes

**8. Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Tools:
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA and visualization
Scikit-learn and xgboost for machine learning
Imbalanced-learn for handling class imbalance
